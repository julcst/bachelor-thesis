  abstract = {The rendering procedure used by neural radiance fields (NeRF) samples a scene with a single ray per pixel and may therefore produce renderings that are excessively blurred or aliased when training or testing images observe scene content at different resolutions. The straightforward solution of supersampling by rendering with multiple rays per pixel is impractical for NeRF, because rendering each ray requires querying a multilayer perceptron hundreds of times. Our solution, which we call “mip-NeRF” (`a la “mipmap”), extends NeRF to represent the scene at a continuously-valued scale. By efficiently rendering anti-aliased conical frustums instead of rays, mip-NeRF reduces objectionable aliasing artifacts and significantly improves NeRF’s ability to represent fine details, while also being 7\% faster than NeRF and half the size. Compared to NeRF, mip-NeRF reduces average error rates by 17\% on the dataset presented with NeRF and by 60\% on a challenging multiscale variant of that dataset that we present. Mip-NeRF is also able to match the accuracy of a brute-force supersampled NeRF on our multiscale dataset while being 22× faster.},

  abstract = {Volume data is commonly found in many scientific disciplines, like medicine, physics, and biology. Experts rely on robust scientific visualization techniques to extract valuable insights from the data. Recent years have shown path tracing to be the preferred approach for volumetric rendering, given its high levels of realism. However, real-time volumetric path tracing often suffers from stochastic noise and long convergence times, limiting interactive exploration. In this paper, we present a novel method to enable real-time global illumination for volume data visualization. We develop Photon Field Networks—a phase-function-aware, multi-light neural representation of indirect volumetric global illumination. The fields are trained on multi-phase photon caches that we compute a priori. Training can be done within seconds, after which the fields can be used in various rendering tasks. To showcase their potential, we develop a custom neural path tracer, with which our photon fields achieve interactive framerates even on large datasets. We conduct in-depth evaluations of the method's performance, including visual quality, stochastic noise, inference and rendering speeds, and accuracy regarding illumination and phase function awareness. Results are compared to ray marching, path tracing and photon mapping. Our findings show that Photon Field Networks can faithfully represent indirect global illumination within the boundaries of the trained phase spectrum while exhibiting less stochastic noise and rendering at a significantly faster rate than traditional methods.},

However, path space filtering may dramatically improve the visual quality by sharing information across vertices of paths classified as "nearby". While thus contributions can be filtered in path space and beyond the first intersection, searching "nearby" paths is more expensive than filtering in screen space. We greatly improve over this performance penalty by storing and looking up the required information in a hash map using hash keys constructed from jittered and quantized information, such that only a single query may replace costly neighborhood searches.},

We repeatedly resample a set of candidate light samples and apply further spatial and temporal resampling to leverage information from relevant nearby samples. We derive an unbiased Monte Carlo estimator for this approach, and show that it achieves equal-error 6×-60× faster than state-of-the-art methods. A biased estimator reduces noise further and is 35×-65× faster, at the cost of some energy loss. We implemented our approach on the GPU, rendering complex scenes containing up to 3.4 million dynamic, emissive triangles in under 50 ms per frame while tracing at most 8 rays per pixel.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an improvement to the stochastic progressive photon mapping (SPPM), a method for robustly simulating complex global illumination with distributed ray tracing effects. Normally, similar to photon mapping and other particle tracing algorithms, SPPM would become inefficient when the photons are poorly distributed. An inordinate amount of photons are required to reduce the error caused by noise and bias to acceptable levels. In order to optimize the distribution of photons, we propose an extension of SPPM with a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, effectively exploiting local coherence among the light paths that contribute to the rendered image. A well-designed scalar contribution function is introduced as our Metropolis sampling strategy, targeting at specific parts of image areas with large error to improve the efficiency of the radiance estimator. Experimental results demonstrate that the new Metropolis sampling based approach maintains the robustness of the standard SPPM method, while significantly improving the rendering efficiency for a wide range of scenes with complex lighting.},

Researchers who devote themselves to this have considered various possibilities. But so far, there has been little discussion about regularizing outputs of the model. This paper begins with empirical observations that better performances are significantly associated with output distributions, that have smaller average values and variances. By audaciously assuming there is causality involved, we propose a novel regularization term, called Output Decay, that enforces the model to assign smaller and similar output values on each class. Though being counter-intuitive, such a small modification result in a remarkable improvement on performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the wide applicability, versatility, and compatibility of Output Decay.},

Using MLMC we split the shading integral into two parts: the radiance cache integral and the residual error integral that compensates for the bias of the first one. For the first part, we developed the Neural Incident Radiance Cache (NIRC) leveraging the power of fully-fused tiny neural networks as a building block, which is trained on the fly. The cache is designed to provide a fast and reasonable approximation of the incident radiance: an evaluation takes 2-25x less compute time than a path tracing sample. This enables us to estimate the radiance cache integral with a high number of samples and by this achieve faster convergence. For the residual error integral, we compute the difference between the NIRC predictions and the unbiased path tracing simulation. Our method makes no assumptions about the geometry, materials, or lighting of a scene and has only few intuitive hyper-parameters. We provide a comprehensive comparative analysis in different experimental scenarios. Since the algorithm is trained in an on-line fashion, it demonstrates significant noise level reduction even for dynamic scenes and can easily be combined with other importance sampling schemes and noise reduction techniques.},

We propose to use a continuous and compact neural implicit representation for encoding parametric models while decoding them via lightweight neural networks. We then derive a gradient-based optimization strategy to directly train the parameters of NPM with noisy Monte Carlo radiance estimates. Our approach efficiently models the target distribution (incident radiance or the product integrand) for path guiding, and outperforms previous guiding methods by capturing the spatio-directional correlations more accurately.

  abstract = {Importance sampling the distribution of visible GGX normals requires sampling those of a hemisphere. In this work, we introduce a novel method for sampling such visible normals. Our method builds upon the insight that a hemispherical mirror reflects parallel light rays uniformly within a solid angle shaped as a spherical cap. This spherical cap has the same apex as the hemispherical mirror, and its aperture given by the angle formed by the orientation of that apex and the direction of incident light rays. Based on this insight, we sample GGX visible normals as halfway vectors between a given incident direction and directions drawn from its associated spherical cap. Our resulting implementation is even simpler than that of Heitz and leads to up to systematic speed-ups in our benchmarks.},

Traditionally, these are accomplished using radius and k-nearest neighbors search operations, which utilize kd-trees and other specialized spatial data structures that fall short of delivering high performance. Recently, advances in ray tracing performance, with respect to both acceleration data structure construction and ray traversal times, have resulted in a wide adoption of the ray tracing paradigm for graphics-related tasks that spread beyond typical image synthesis. In this work, we propose an alternative formulation of the radius search operation that maps the problem to the ray tracing paradigm, in order to take advantage of the available GPU-accelerated solutions for it. We demonstrate the performance gain relative to traditional spatial search methods, especially on dynamically updated sample sets, using two representative applications: geometry processing point-wise operations on scanned point clouds and global illumination via progressive photon mapping.},

Abstract This work proposes a GPU friendly irradiance caching (IC) solution, where performance critical parts of an irradiance cache algorithm are done completely on the GPU. We discuss some practical problems arising in the implementation of GPU irradiance caching, and propose solutions for them. The modified algorithm for the GPU is different from a CPU implementation in 2 ways. The first distinction is a multi-pass construction of irradiance cache followed by a final rendering stage and the second distinction is to insert a large record set at once instead of one by one, as used in traditional approaches. We also consider some details to efficiently implement look-up operations on the GPU.},

  abstract = {Developing robust light transport simulation algorithms that are capable of dealing with arbitrary input scenes remains an elusive challenge. Although efficient global illumination algorithms exist, an acceptable approximation error in a reasonable amount of time is usually only achieved for specific types of input scenes. To address this problem, we present a reformulation of photon mapping as a bidirectional path sampling technique for Monte Carlo light transport simulation. The benefit of our new formulation is twofold. First, it makes it possible, for the first time, to explain in a formal manner the relative efficiency of photon mapping and bidirectional path tracing, which have so far been considered conceptually incompatible solutions to the light transport problem. Second, it allows for a seamless integration of the two methods into a more robust combined rendering algorithm via multiple importance sampling. A progressive version of this algorithm is consistent and efficiently handles a wide variety of lighting conditions, ranging from direct illumination, diffuse and glossy inter-reflections, to specular-diffusespecular light transport. Our analysis shows that this algorithm inherits the high asymptotic performance from bidirectional path tracing for most light path types, while benefiting from the efficiency of photon mapping for specular-diffuse-specular lighting effects.},

Progressive photon mapping is a multi-pass algorithm where the first pass is ray tracing followed by any number of photon tracing passes. Each photon tracing pass results in an increasingly accurate global illumination solution that can be visualized in order to provide progressive feedback. Progressive photon mapping uses a new radiance estimate that converges to the correct radiance value as more photons are used. It is not necessary to store the full photon map, and unlike standard photon mapping it possible to compute a global illumination solution with any desired accuracy using a limited amount of memory. Compared with existing Monte Carlo ray tracing methods progressive photon mapping provides an efficient and robust alternative in the presence of complex light transport such as caustics and in particular reflections of caustics.},

Progressive photon mapping is a robust global illumination algorithm that can handle complex illumination settings including specular-diffuse-specular paths. The algorithm can compute the correct radiance value at a point in the limit. However, progressive photon mapping is not effective at rendering distributed ray tracing effects, such as depth-of-field, that requires multiple pixel samples in order to compute the correct average radiance value over a region. In this paper, we introduce a new formulation of progressive photon mapping, called stochastic progressive photon mapping, which makes it possible to compute the correct average radiance value for a region. The key idea is to use shared photon statistics within the region rather than isolated photon statistics at a point. The algorithm is easy to implement, and our results demonstrate how it efficiently handles scenes with distributed ray tracing effects, while maintaining the robustness of progressive photon mapping in scenes with complex lighting.},

We develop a ReSTIR variant incorporating bidirectional path tracing that significantly improves the sampling quality in these scenes. Combining bidirectional path tracing and ReSTIR introduces multiple challenges: the generalized resampled importance sampling (GRIS) behind ReSTIR is, by default, not aware of how a path was sampled, which complicates reuse of bidirectional paths. Light tracing is also challenging since light subpaths can contribute to all pixels. To address these challenges, we apply GRIS in a sampling technique-aware extended path space, design a bidirectional hybrid shift mapping, and introduce caustics reservoirs that can accumulate caustics across frames. Our method takes around 50ms per frame across our test scenes, and achieves significantly lower error compared to prior unidirectional ReSTIR variants running in equal time.},

Our main motivation is to define a correct (geometrically indicated), physically based masking function for application in microfacet models, as well as the properties that function should exhibit. Indeed, several different masking functions are often presented in the literature and making the right choice is not always obvious. We start by showing that physically based masking functions are constrained by the projected area of the visible microsurface onto the outgoing direction. We use this property to derive the distribution of visible normals from the microsurface, whose normalization factor is the masking function. We then show how the common form of microfacet-based BRDFs emerges from this distribution. As a consequence, the masking function is related to the correct normalization of microfacetbased BRDFs. However, while the correct masking function satisfies these normalization constraints, its explicit form is can only be determined for a given microsurface profile.},

Previously proposed sampling schemes for popular analytic BSDFs typically begin by choosing a microfacet normal at random in a way that is independent of direction of incident light. To sample the full BSDF using these normals requires arbitrarily large sample weights leading to possible fireflies. Additionally, at grazing angles nearly half of the sampled normals face away from the incident ray and must be rejected, making the sampling scheme inefficient. Instead, we show how to use the distribution of visible normals directly to generate samples, where normals are weighted by their projection factor toward the incident direction. In this way, no backfacing normals are sampled and the sample weights contain only the shadowing factor of outgoing rays (and additionally a Fresnel term for conductors). Arbitrarily large sample weights are avoided and variance is reduced. Since the BSDF depends on the microsurface model, we describe our sampling algorithm for two models: the V‐cavity and the Smith models. We demonstrate results for both isotropic and anisotropic rough conductors and dielectrics with Beckmann and GGX distributions.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a two pass global illumination method based on the concept of photon maps. It represents a significant improvement of a previously described approach both with respect to speed, accuracy and versatility. In the first pass two photon maps are created by emitting packets of energy (photons) from the light sources and storing these as they hit surfaces within the scene. We use one high resolution caustics photon map to render caustics that are visualized directly and one low resolution photon map that is used during the rendering step. The scene is rendered using a distribution ray tracing algorithm optimized by using the information in the photon maps. Shadow photons are used to render shadows more efficiently and the directional information in the photon map is used to generate optimized sampling directions and to limit the recursion in the distribution ray tracer by providing an estimate of the radiance on all surfaces with the exception of specular and highly glossy surfaces.},

It is the result of an analysis of the radiance estimation in progressive photon mapping. As a first step, we establish a connection to the field of recursive estimation and regression in statistics and derive the optimal estimation parameters for the asymptotic convergence of existing approaches. Next, we show how to reformulate photon mapping as a spatial regression in the measurement equation of light transport. This reformulation allows us to derive a novel data-driven bandwidth selection technique for estimating a pixel's measurement. The proposed technique possesses attractive convergence properties with finite numbers of samples, which is important for progressive rendering, and it also provides better results for quasi-converged images. Our results show the practical benefits of using our adaptive method.},

  abstract = {Achieving real-time global illumination for a given scene remains challenging, even with the advent of hardware ray tracing, due to the substantial quantity of rays required. To enhance the quality of the limited number of samples, spatial and temporal resampling can be used. The concept of resampling gained popularity with ReSTIR DI [BWP*20], enabling real-time direct illumination for scenes with millions of lights. This concept was further extended by combining it with path tracing to quickly approximate the indirect illumination (ReSTIR GI [OLK*21]) or correctly approximate global illumination (ReSTIR PT [LKB*22] and Suffix ReSTIR [KLR*23]). However, these algorithms fall short in effectively rendering caustic effects -bundles of reflected or refracted light- often associated with photon mapping. We introduce ReSTIR FG, an efficient real time indirect illumination algorithm that combines photon final gathering with the principles of ReSTIR. First, we introduce an efficient photon final gathering scheme, enabling quick consistent offline rendering. Then we combine our photon final gathering with spatiotemporal resampling to allow for real time global illumination. Our algorithm is capable of displaying multi bounce indirect illumination, as well as caustic effects, while remaining competitive in both runtime and quality when compared to the aforementioned state-of-the-art global illumination resampling techniques.},

  abstract = {Irradiance caching is a ray tracing-based technique for computing global illumination on diffuse surfaces. Specifically, it addresses the computation of indirect illumination bouncing off one diffuse object onto another. The sole purpose of irradiance caching is to make this computation reasonably fast. The main idea is to perform the indirect illumination sampling only at a selected set of locations in the scene, store the results in a cache, and reuse the cached value at other points through fast interpolation. This book is for anyone interested in making a production-ready implementation of irradiance caching that reliably renders artifact-free images. Since its invention 20 years ago, the irradiance caching algorithm has been successfully used to accelerate global illumination computation in the Radiance lighting simulation system. Its widespread use had to wait until computers became fast enough to consider global illumination in film production rendering. Since then, its use is ubiquitous. Virtually all commercial and open-source rendering software base the global illumination computation upon irradiance caching. Although elegant and powerful, the algorithm in its basic form often fails to produce artifact-free mages. Unfortunately, practical information on implementing the algorithm is scarce. The main objective of this book is to show the irradiance caching algorithm along with all the details and tricks upon which the success of its practical implementation is dependent. In addition, we discuss some extensions of the basic algorithm, such as a GPU implementation for interactive global illumination computation and temporal caching that exploits temporal coherence to suppress flickering in animations. Our goal is to show the material without being overly theoretical. However, the reader should have some basic understanding of rendering concepts, ray tracing in particular. Familiarity with global illumination is useful but not necessary to read this book.

  abstract = {As scenes become ever more complex and real-time applications embrace ray tracing, path sampling algorithms that maximize quality at low sample counts become vital. Recent               resampling               algorithms building on Talbot et al.'s [2005] resampled importance sampling (RIS) reuse paths spatiotemporally to render surprisingly complex light transport with a few samples per pixel. These reservoir-based spatiotemporal importance resamplers (ReSTIR) and their underlying RIS theory make various assumptions, including sample independence. But sample reuse               introduces correlation               , so ReSTIR-style iterative reuse loses most convergence guarantees that RIS theoretically provides.                          We introduce generalized resampled importance sampling (GRIS) to extend the theory, allowing RIS on correlated samples, with unknown PDFs and taken from varied domains. This solidifies the theoretical foundation, allowing us to derive variance bounds and convergence conditions in ReSTIR-based samplers. It also guides practical algorithm design and enables advanced path reuse between pixels via complex shift mappings.             We show a path-traced resampler (ReSTIR PT) running interactively on complex scenes, capturing many-bounce diffuse and specular lighting while shading just one path per pixel. With our new theoretical foundation, we can also modify the algorithm to guarantee convergence for offline renderers.},

  abstract = {We present a robust, unbiased technique for intelligent light-path construction in path-tracing algorithms. Inspired by existing path-guiding algorithms, our method learns an approximate representation of the scene’s spatio-directional radiance field in an unbiased and iterative manner. To that end, we propose an adaptive spatio-directional hybrid data structure, referred to as SD-tree, for storing and sampling incident radiance. The SD-tree consists of an upper part—a binary tree that partitions the 3D spatial domain of the light field—and a lower part—a quadtree that partitions the 2D directional domain. We further present a principled way to automatically budget training and rendering computations to minimize the variance of the final image. Our method does not require tuning hyperparameters, although we allow limiting the memory footprint of the SD-tree. The aforementioned properties, its ease of implementation, and its stable performance make our method compatible with production environments. We demonstrate the merits of our method on scenes with difficult visibility, detailed geometry, and complex specular-glossy light transport, achieving better performance than previous state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract = {We propose to use deep neural networks for generating samples in Monte Carlo integration. Our work is based on non-linear independent components estimation (NICE), which we extend in numerous ways to improve performance and enable its application to integration problems. First, we introduce piecewise-polynomial coupling transforms that greatly increase the modeling power of individual coupling layers. Second, we propose to preprocess the inputs of neural networks using one-blob encoding, which stimulates localization of computation and improves inference. Third, we derive a gradient-descent-based optimization for the KL and the \$\textbackslash chi\textasciicircum 2\$ divergence for the specific application of Monte Carlo integration with unnormalized stochastic estimates of the target distribution. Our approach enables fast and accurate inference and efficient sample generation independently of the dimensionality of the integration domain. We show its benefits on generating natural images and in two applications to light-transport simulation: first, we demonstrate learning of joint path-sampling densities in the primary sample space and importance sampling of multi-dimensional path prefixes thereof. Second, we use our technique to extract conditional directional densities driven by the product of incident illumination and the BSDF in the rendering equation, and we leverage the densities for path guiding. In all applications, our approach yields on-par or higher performance than competing techniques at equal sample count.},

  abstract = {We propose neural control variates (NCV) for unbiased variance reduction in parametric Monte Carlo integration. So far, the core challenge of applying the method of control variates has been finding a good approximation of the integrand that is cheap to integrate. We show that a set of neural networks can face that challenge: a normalizing flow that approximates the shape of the integrand and another neural network that infers the solution of the integral equation. We also propose to leverage a neural importance sampler to estimate the difference between the original integrand and the learned control variate. To optimize the resulting parametric estimator, we derive a theoretically optimal, variance-minimizing loss function, and propose an alternative, composite loss for stable online training in practice. When applied to light transport simulation, neural control variates are capable of matching the state-of-the-art performance of other unbiased approaches, while providing means to develop more performant, practical solutions. Specifically, we show that the learned light-field approximation is of sufficient quality for high-order bounces, allowing us to omit the error correction and thereby dramatically reduce the noise at the cost of negligible visible bias.},

Our system is designed to handle fully dynamic scenes, and makes no assumptions about the lighting, geometry, and materials. The data-driven nature of our approach sidesteps many difficulties of caching algorithms, such as locating, interpolating, and updating cache points. Since pretraining neural networks to handle novel, dynamic scenes is a formidable generalization challenge, we do away with pretraining and instead achieve               generalization via adaptation               , i.e. we opt for training the radiance cache while rendering. We employ self-training to provide low-noise training targets and simulate infinite-bounce transport by merely iterating few-bounce training updates. The updates and cache queries incur a mild overhead---about 2.6ms on full HD resolution---thanks to a streaming implementation of the neural network that fully exploits modern hardware. We demonstrate significant noise reduction at the cost of little induced bias, and report state-of-the-art, real-time performance on a number of challenging scenarios.},

We reduce this cost with a versatile new input encoding that permits the use of a smaller network without sacrificing quality, thus significantly reducing the number of floating point and memory access operations: a small neural network is augmented by a multiresolution hash table of trainable feature vectors whose values are optimized through stochastic gradient descent. The multiresolution structure allows the network to disambiguate hash collisions, making for a simple architecture that is trivial to parallelize on modern GPUs. We leverage this parallelism by implementing the whole system using fully-fused CUDA kernels with a focus on minimizing wasted bandwidth and compute operations. We achieve a combined speedup of several orders of magnitude, enabling training of high-quality neural graphics primitives in a matter of seconds, and rendering in tens of milliseconds at a resolution of 1920×1080.},

Monte Carlo (MC) sampling typically attains a root mean squared error (RMSE) of \$O(n\textasciicircum\{-1/2\})\$ from \$n\$ independent random function evaluations. By contrast, quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling using carefully equispaced evaluation points can attain the rate \$O(n\textasciicircum\{-1+\textbackslash varepsilon\})\$ for any \$\textbackslash varepsilon{$>$}0\$ and randomized QMC (RQMC) can attain the RMSE \$O(n\textasciicircum\{-3/2+\textbackslash varepsilon\})\$, both under mild conditions on \$f\$. Classical variance reduction methods for MC can be adapted to QMC. Published results combining QMC with importance sampling and with control variates have found worthwhile improvements, but no change in the error rate. This paper extends the classical variance reduction method of antithetic sampling and combines it with RQMC. One such method is shown to bring a modest improvement in the RMSE rate, attaining \$O(n\textasciicircum\{-3/2-1/d+\textbackslash varepsilon\})\$ for any \$\textbackslash varepsilon{$>$}0\$, for smooth enough \$f\$.},

  abstract = {Photon mapping (PM) has been widely regarded as an efficient solution for light transport simulation, including challenging caustics paths and many-bounce indirect lighting. The efficiency of PM comes from reusing traced photons. However, the handling of photon gathering in existing PM algorithms is universally biased -- the expected value of their results does not necessarily agree with the true solution of the rendering equation. We present a novel photon gathering method to efficiently achieve unbiased rendering with photon mapping. Instead of aggregating the gathered photons into an estimated density as in classical photon mapping, we process each photon individually and connect the corresponding light sub-path with the eye sub-path that generates the gather point, creating an unbiased path sample. The Monte Carlo estimate for such a path sample is calculated by evaluating all relevant terms in a strict and unbiased way, leading to a self-contained unbiased sampling technique. We further develop a set of multiple importance sampling (MIS) weights that allow our method to be optimally combined with bidirectional path tracing (BDPT), resulting in an unbiased rendering algorithm that can efficiently handle a wide variety of light paths and that compares favorably with previous algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our method.},

Since the very beginning of computer graphics, adequate modeling of these processes and efficient computation is an intensively studied research topic and still not a solved problem. The inherent complexity stems from the underlying physical processes as well as the global nature of the interactions that let light travel within a scene. This article reviews the state of the art in interactive global illumination computation, that is, methods that generate an image of a virtual scene in less than one second with an as exact as possible, or plausible, solution to the light transport. Additionally, the theoretical background and attempts to classify the broad field of methods are described. The strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, when applied to the different visual phenomena, arising from light interaction are compared and discussed. Finally, the article concludes by highlighting design patterns for interactive global illumination and a list of open problems.},

While there are a number of effective global illumination techniques based on precomputation that work well with static scenes, including global illumination for scenes with dynamic lighting and dynamic geometry remains a challenging problem. In this chapter, we describe a real-time global illumination algorithm based on photon mapping that evaluates several bounces of indirect lighting without any precomputed data in scenes with both dynamic lighting and fully dynamic geometry. We explain both the pre- and post-processing steps required to achieve dynamic high-quality illumination within the limits of a realtime frame budget.},

  abstract = {Achieving global illumination is crucial for delivering realistic lighting in real-time rendering applications. Despite recent advancements in hardware ray tracing, the computational demands of full path tracing remain largely impractical for real-world production scenarios. We introduce a novel two-level radiance caching system that exclusively utilizes on-surface caches, diverging from conventional approaches that combine screen-space and world-space caches. Unlike previous texture space techniques, which mostly prioritize closely matching the resolution to screen space to minimize artifacts, our focus is on achieving optimal visual quality with minimal texture space resolutions. By caching directional radiance information on both primary and secondary hits, our approach delivers high-quality renderings of global illumination while being computationally efficient. Overall, this leads to an up to 5\% to 10\% improvement in both speed and quality compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. Our proposed method is versatile, handling not only diffuse global illumination but also addressing (glossy) reflections. Furthermore, our approach is well-suited for multi-viewer rendering, as the utilization of on-surface caches enables information sharing among different viewers, making it applicable to cloud-native rendering environments.},

A Monte Carlo technique computes the indirect contributions to illuminance at locations chosen by the rendering process. The indirect illuminance values are averaged over surfaces and used in place of a constant "ambient" term. Illuminance calculations are made only for those areas participating in the selected view, and the results are stored so that subsequent views can reuse common values. The density of the calculation is adjusted to maintain a constant accuracy, permitting less populated portions of the scene to be computed quickly. Successive reflections use proportionally fewer samples, which speeds the process and provides a natural limit to recursion. The technique can also model diffuse transmission and illumination from large area sources, such as the sky.},

Not only the glossy appearance but also global illumination effects, including reflections of other objects in the environment, are critical components to faithfully reproduce a scene. In this paper, we present Neural Directional Encoding (NDE), a view-dependent appearance encoding of neural radiance fields (NeRF) for rendering specular objects. NDE transfers the concept of feature-grid-based spatial encoding to the angular domain, significantly improving the ability to model high-frequency angular signals. In contrast to previous methods that use encoding functions with only angular input, we additionally cone-trace spatial features to obtain a spatially varying directional encoding, which addresses the challenging interreflection effects. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show that a NeRF model with NDE (1) outperforms the state of the art on view synthesis of specular objects, and (2) works with small networks to allow fast (real-time) inference.

  abstract = {In recent years, reservoir-based spatiotemporal importance resampling (ReSTIR) algorithms appeared out of nowhere to take parts of the realtime rendering community by storm, with sample reuse speeding direct lighting from millions of dynamic lights [1], diffuse multi-bounce lighting [2], participating media [3], and even complex global illumination paths [4]. Highly optimized variants (e.g. [5]) can give 100x efficiency improvement over traditional ray- and path-tracing methods; this is key to achieve 30 or 60 Hz framerates. In production engines, tracing even one ray or path per pixel may only be feasible on the highest-end systems, so maximizing image quality per sample is vital.ReSTIR builds on the math in Talbot et al.'s [6] resampled importance sampling (RIS), which previously was not widely used or taught, leaving many practitioners missing key intuitions and theoretical grounding. A firm grounding is vital, as seemingly obvious "optimizations" arising during ReSTIR engine integration can silently introduce conditional probabilities and dependencies that, left ignored, add uncontrollable bias to the results.In this course, we plan to:1. Provide concrete motivation and intuition for why ReSTIR works, where it applies, what assumptions it makes, and the limitations of today's theory and implementations;2. Gently develop the theory, targeting attendees with basic Monte Carlo sampling experience but without prior knowledge of resampling algorithms (e.g., Talbot et al. [6]);3. Give explicit algorithmic samples and pseudocode, pointing out easily-encountered pitfalls when implementing ReSTIR;4. Discuss actual game integrations, highlighting the gotchas, challenges, and corner cases we encountered along the way, and highlighting ReSTIR's practical benefits.},

Recent advances in neural rendering demonstrate new promising possibilities. However, while existing methods have achieved impressive results, complex rendering effects (e.g., caustics) remain challenging. This paper presents a novel neural rendering method that is able to generate high-quality global illumination effects, including but not limited to caustics, soft shadows, and indirect highlights, for dynamic scenes with varying camera, lighting conditions, materials, and object transformations. Inspired by object-oriented transfer field representations, we employ deformable neural feature fields to implicitly model the impacts of individual objects or light sources on global illumination. By employing neural feature fields, our method gains the ability to represent high-frequency details, thus supporting complex rendering effects. We superpose these feature fields in latent space and utilize a lightweight decoder to obtain global illumination estimates, which allows our neural representations to spontaneously adapt to the contribution of individual objects or light sources to global illumination in a data-driven manner, thus further improving the quality. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a wide range of scenes with complex light paths, materials, and geometries.},

This algorithm achieves real-time performance by exploiting the GPU's streaming architecture at all stages of kd-tree construction. Unlike previous parallel kd-tree algorithms, our method builds tree nodes completely in BFS (breadth-first search) order. We also develop a special strategy for large nodes at upper tree levels so as to further exploit the fine-grained parallelism of GPUs. For these nodes, we parallelize the computation over all geometric primitives instead of nodes at each level. Finally, in order to maintain kd-tree quality, we introduce novel schemes for fast evaluation of node split costs.As far as we know, ours is the first real-time kd-tree algorithm on the GPU. The kd-trees built by our algorithm are of comparable quality as those constructed by off-line CPU algorithms. In terms of speed, our algorithm is significantly faster than well-optimized single-core CPU algorithms and competitive with multi-core CPU algorithms. Our algorithm provides a general way for handling dynamic scenes on the GPU. We demonstrate the potential of our algorithm in applications involving dynamic scenes, including GPU ray tracing, interactive photon mapping, and point cloud modeling.}

These approaches are aimed at path tracing, which is not ideal for simulating challenging light transport effects like caustics, where photon mapping is the method of choice. However, photon mapping requires very large numbers of traced photons to achieve high-quality reconstructions. In this paper, we develop the first deep learning-based method for particle-based rendering, and specifically focus on photon density estimation, the core of all particle-based methods. We train a novel deep neural network to predict a kernel function to aggregate photon contributions at shading points. Our network encodes individual photons into per-photon features, aggregates them in the neighborhood of a shading point to construct a photon local context vector, and infers a kernel function from the per-photon and photon local context features. This network is easy to incorporate in many previous photon mapping methods (by simply swapping the kernel density estimator) and can produce high-quality reconstructions of complex global illumination effects like caustics with an order of magnitude fewer photons compared to previous photon mapping methods.},

  abstract = {In mathematical analysis and computer science, functions which are Z-order, Lebesgue curve, Morton space-filling curve, Morton order or Morton code map multidimensional data to one dimension while preserving locality of the data points (two points close together in multidimensions with high probability lie also close together in Morton order). It is named in France after Henri Lebesgue, who studied it in 1904, and named in the United States after Guy Macdonald Morton, who first applied the order to file sequencing in 1966. The z-value of a point in multidimensions is simply calculated by bit interleaving the binary representations of its coordinate values. However, when querying a multidimensional search range in these data, using binary search is not really efficient: It is necessary for calculating, from a point encountered in the data structure, the next possible Z-value which is in the multidimensional search range, called BIGMIN. The BIGMIN problem has first been stated and its solution shown by Tropf and Herzog in 1981. Once the data are sorted by bit interleaving, any one-dimensional data structure can be used, such as simple one dimensional arrays, binary search trees, B-trees, skip lists or (with low significant bits truncated) hash tables. The resulting ordering can equivalently be described as the order one would get from a depth-first traversal of a quadtree or octree.},
