\paragraph{Contributions}
To summarize, my contributions are the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item I propose a generalized theoretical framework for Neural Radiance Caching by \textcite{muller2021}, allowing for arbitrary and independent modifications to the inference, training and interpolation steps.
    \item For the inference step, I introduce a modification to the directional input encoding that can prevent artifacts caused by the pole singularities of spherical coordinates.
    \item For the training step, I propose three novel training methods:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A bidirectional training approach that excels at capturing complex indirect lighting effects.
        \item A light tracing technique that is able to learn sharp caustic features.
        \item An adaptation of Progressive Photon Mapping \parencite{jensen1996,hachisuka2008} that robustly learns both indirect lighting and caustics, essentially performing path space denoising for Progressive Photon Mapping.
    \end{itemize}
