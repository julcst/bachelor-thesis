The research related to this thesis can be divided into three main categories:
First, I will give a general overview over approaches to the global illumination problem.
Secondly, I will specifically discuss approaches that reuse computed radiance estimates across frames or space.
Finally, I will take a look into approaches that introduce neural networks into rendering.
