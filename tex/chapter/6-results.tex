\chapter{Results}
\label{chap:results}
For the purpose of reproducible evaluation, I have implemented a JSON-configurable CLI tool that was used to generate all results presented in this thesis and the exact parametrization is distributed along the source code on my repository \parencite{stamm2025}.
For the performance evaluation I use Cuda Events, tone mapping and blitting to the screen were not included into the measurements.
