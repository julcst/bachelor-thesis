\section{Methodology}
For the purpose of reproducible evaluation, a JSON-configurable CLI tool was used to generate all results presented in this thesis and the exact parametrization is distributed along the source code on my repository \parencite{stamm2025}.

\paragraph{Performance Measurement}
Cuda Events are used to evaluate performance.
Tone mapping and screen blitting are not included into the measurements, so only the pure rendering time is reported.
If not otherwise stated, all measurements are taken on an NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti GPU and averaged over at least 10 seconds.

\paragraph{Error Metric}
Reference images are generated using Path Tracing (PT) or Stochastic Progressive Photon Mapping (SPPM) \parencite{hachisuka2009a} in caustic scenes where PT does not converge.
To compare the quality of different techniques, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) in linear RGB space is reported for numerical error and the HDR variant of the \FLIP metric \parencite{andersson2021} for humanly perceived error.
Furthermore, bias and variance are measured separately by computing the first and second moment over 1000 independent 1spp renders.
Between the bias and variance samples the configuration and cache are kept constant, but for the inference pass different samples are drawn from a Quasi-Random Low Discrepancy Sequence.

\paragraph{Scenes}
Tests are performed on a set of scenes that are also included in the source code repository \parencite{stamm2025}:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \emph{Diffuse} scene is an adaptation of the Cornell Box and highlights diffuse indirect illumination.
\item The \emph{Thinker} scene incorporates glossy and transmissive materials with complex specular highlights.
It contains decimated and remeshed version of the Thinker statue by Auguste Rodin scanned by \textcite{scantheworld2014} and the Stanford Bunny scanned by \textcite{stanforduniversitycomputergraphicslaboratory1994}.
\item The \emph{Chess} scene is a complex textured scene composed of public domain assets from \textcite{polyhaven}.
\item The \emph{Ajar} scene is mostly lit by long indirect light paths, which are difficult to find with eye tracing.
\item The \emph{Caustics} scene contains complex sharp caustic patterns that are challenging for traditional path tracing.
\end{itemize}

            SER, 70\% & 124.46ms & $-22\%$\\

    \caption{Optimizations to Photon Mapping. \emph{IS only} directly accumulates in the Intersection Shader (IS) and skips the Any Hit Shader (AH). \emph{SER} uses Shader Execution Reordering between the Intersection and Any Hit shader to improve coherence. \emph{SER, 70\%} additionally rejects 70\% of the non-caustic photons in the Any Hit shader \parencite{kern2023}. \emph{SER, 70\%, 30$^{\circ}$} rejects photon hits whose surface normals deviate more than 30° from the surface normals at the query point \parencite{kern2023}. The most notable performance improvement comes from rejecting non-caustic photons, however, this notably increases error in non-caustic areas. Rejecting photons based on normal deviation has a small positive performance impact and decreases bias.}

The resolution sequence is linear in total pixel count, going up to FullHD-equivalent $1440^2$px. Measurements are averaged over 10s. Note, that PT has a near zero constant overhead, but a significantly higher per-pixel cost, whereas both Radiance Caching techniques have a much lower per-pixel cost but higher overhead.}
