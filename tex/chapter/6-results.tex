\chapter{Results}
\label{chap:results}

For the purpose of reproducible evaluation, I have implemented a JSON-configurable CLI tool that was used to generate all results presented in this thesis and the exact parametrization is distributed along the source code on the repository.
For the performance evaluation I used Cuda Events, tone mapping and blitting to the screen were not included into the measurements.
