\label{chap:results}
For the purpose of reproducible evaluation, I have implemented a JSON-configurable CLI tool that was used to generate all results presented in this thesis and the exact parametrization is distributed along the source code on my repository \parencite{stamm2025}.
For the performance evaluation I use Cuda Events.
Tone mapping and blitting to the screen were not included into the measurements.

    \caption{Performance vs resolution of SPPC. For reference, the performance of PT (black line) and NRC+PT (purple line) is also shown. The resolution sequence is linear in total pixel count, going up to FullHD-equivalent $1440^2$px. Note, that PT has a near zero constant overhead, but a significantly higher per-pixel cost, whereas both Radiance Caching techniques have a much lower per-pixel cost but higher overhead.}
