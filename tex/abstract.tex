In this thesis, I explore the topic of online radiance caching in the context of real-time rendering.
Therefore, I will leverage the potential of neural networks to learn representations of the radiance field as proposed by \textcite{muller2021}.

Furthermore, I propose a theoretical abstraction of radiance caching, which I use to introduce three novel training techniques that leverage light tracing to improve the radiance cache's performance for difficult light paths including caustics and indirect illumination.

To achieve real-time performance, I provide an efficient implementation incorporating modern graphics hardware features such as hardware accelerated ray tracing and tensor cores.
