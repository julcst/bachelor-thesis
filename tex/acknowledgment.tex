I want to thank my advisor, Tom Kneiphof, for his precious guidance and his invaluable insights and feedback.
I also want to thank my family and friends for their constant backing and accompaniment throughout my studies.
Special thanks, I want to give to Alexa for her unwavering encouragement and unconditional support.
